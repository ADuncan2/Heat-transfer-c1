Here we report a ﬂexible hybrid piezoelectric ﬁber based two-dimensional fabric nanogenerator which can be promising to be easily integrated with clothing and convert the mechanical energy of human body motion into electric energy. The hybrid piezoelectric ﬁber comprised aligned BaTiO3 nanowires and PVC polymer. The PVC polymer made the ﬁber be enough ﬂexible for performing the woven process and the aligned BaTiO3 nanowires enhanced the piezoelectric properties as active materials. The metal copper wires and cotton threads were woven into the fabric to construct the nanogenerator with interdigited electrodes. By attaching the fabric nanogenerator on an elbow pad which was bended by human arms, the nanogenerator can generate 1.9 V output voltage and 24 nA output current and the output are large enough to power a LCD.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades the use of portable and wearable electronics has grown steadily. These devices are becoming increasingly more powerful. However, the gains that have been made in the device performance have resulted in the need for significantly higher power to operate the electronics. This issue has been further complicated due to the stagnant growth of battery technology over the past decade. In order to increase the life of these electronics, researchers have begun investigating methods of generating energy from ambient sources such that the life of the electronics can be prolonged. Recent developments in the field have led to the design of a number of mechanisms that can be used to generate electrical energy, from a variety of sources including thermal, solar, strain, inertia, etc. Many of these energy sources are available for use with humans, but their use must be carefully considered such that parasitic effects that could disrupt the user's gait or endurance are avoided. These issues have arisen from previous attempts to integrate power harvesting mechanisms into a shoe such that the energy released during a heal strike could be harvested. This study develops a novel energy harvesting backpack that can generate electrical energy from the differential forces between the wearer and the pack. The goal of this system is to make the energy harvesting device transparent to the wearer such that his or her endurance and dexterity is not compromised. This will be accomplished by replacing the traditional strap of the backpack with one made of the piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Piezoelectric materials have a structure such that an applied electrical potential results in a mechanical strain. Conversely, an applied stress results in the generation of an electrical charge, which makes the material useful for power harvesting applications. PVDF is highly flexible and has a high strength, allowing it to effectively act as the load bearing member. In order to preserve the performance of the backpack and user, the design of the pack will be held as close to existing systems as possible. This paper develops a theoretical model of the piezoelectric strap and uses experimental testing to identify its performance in this application.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing demand for portable power sources because of the rapid development of portable and wearable electronic devices. This paper describes the development of a backpack-based energy harvester to harness the biomechanical energy of the human body during walking. The energy harvester was embedded into a backpack and used a spring-mass-damping system to transfer the energetic motion of the human body into rotary generators to produce electricity. In the oscillation system, the weight of the harvester itself and the load contained in the backpack serve together as the seismic mass; when excited by human trunk motion, the seismic mass drives a gear train to accelerate the harvested energetic motion, which is then delivered to a generator. A prototype device was built to investigate its performance, which has a maximum diameter of 50mm, a minimum diameter of 28mm, a length of 250mm, and a weight of 380g. Experiments showed that the proposed backpack-based harvester, when operating with a 5kg load, could produce approximately 7W of electrical power at a walking velocity of 5.5km/h. The normalized power density of the harvester is 0.145kg/cm3, which is 7.6 times as much as that of Rome’s backpack harvester [26]. Based on the results of metabolic cost experiments, the average conversion efficiency from human metabolic power to electrical power is approximately 36\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/AIM.2018.8452373},
	abstract = {The exploration of biomechanical energy harvesting has taken places for more than a decade, with the purpose to enable more wearable electronics to power themselves by scavenging the energy associated with the local body motions. In the studies of energy harvesting backpack, most of the previous designs were built by responding to the inertia-driven excitation in the vertical direction during walking. Based on scrutiny of the human walking posture when wearing a backpack, we find that the vertical movement of the backpack only dominates in brisk walking or jogging. The horizontal swing plays a more significant role when the walking speed is lower than 4 km/h, which is the normal walking speed of healthy people. According to this finding, this paper proposes a light weight and non-resonant type backpack harvester for harvesting energy under different walking speeds. A prototyped harvesting backpack is manufactured, tested, and validated with the theoretical model. The experiment shows that, when the test subject walks at 4 km/h wearing a backpack of 1.5 kg, the prototyped harvester, whose weights is 0.5 kg, can harvest about 0.3-watt power. Testing results also show that the energy harvesting function in the proposed design does not impede the walking posture.},

	doi = {10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260882},
	abstract = {A biomechanical energy harvesting backpack that generates electricity during human walking is presented. By recognizing the out-of-phase motion between two limbs, this energy harvesting technology differs from previous designs in a way that it integrates the motion from both of the user's lower limbs into a single mechanical drive train and generator. A prototype was developed and experimental results demonstrated that the device was able to generate a large amount of electricity (9W) with a efficiency of 72\%, which is higher than the existing walking based energy harvesters. To quantify the performance of the harvester we introduced a new performance measure, total cost of harvesting (TCOH), which evaluates a harvesters overall efficiency in generating electricity including the device carrying cost. The new harvester captured the motion from both lower limbs and operated in the generative braking mode to assist the knee flexor muscles in slowing the lower limbs. From testing on 10 participants, under different walking conditions, the harvester achieved an average TCOH of 6.1, which is comparable to the estimated TCOH for a conventional power generation method of 6.2. When generating 5.2W of electricity, the TCOH of the lower limb-driven energy harvester (4.0) is lower than that of conventional power generation methods. These results demonstrated that the lower limb-driven energy harvester is an energetically effective option for generating electricity during daily activities.},

The harvester employed a tuning mechanism to adjust the stretch ratio of the springs to adjust the system׳s stiffness so that the harvesting device can work in an appropriate status to generate more power and relieve a greater load from the bearer. The analysis indicates that adjusting the stiffness harvesting system to fit well with various external excitation conditions, can not only achieve more power output but also relieve part of the accelerative load from the bearer; and the experimental results agreed with the simulation.

In the energy harvester, a spring–mass damping system is used to transform the human body’s movement during walking into the rotation of a gear train and drive rotary generators to produce electricity to recharge the battery through a rectifying circuit. A mathematical model was built to examine the power output of the energy harvester under different excitation conditions. A prototype was built to test the performances of the harvester, and experiments on the prototype fixed on the ankle, wrist, and torso were conducted, which indicated that the measured power output was 0.35 W, 0.16 W, and 10 mW, respectively, when testers walked at 2.0 m/s (the circular frequency of foot step is about 14.5 rad/s). The experiments indicate that a higher walking velocity as well as excitation amplitude and frequency could result in higher output power.},

	abstract = {A nonlinearly broadband tuneable energy harvesting device has been designed, fabricated, and tested based on the nonlinear dynamical response of a parametrically excited clamped–clamped beam carrying a central point mass as the core element; a tuning mechanism in the form of an initial axial displacement applied to one of the clamped–clamped beam ends has been introduced to the system which enables tuning of device's natural frequency. Magnets have been used as the central point mass which generates a backward electromotive force (EMF) as they move through a coil when parametrically excited. The tuning parameter was set to a value for which the primary and principal nonlinear resonant regions become close to each other; hence, the frequency bandwidth is broadened substantially, leading to a larger amount of electrical power harvested; moreover, the nonlinear behavior, due to flexural/restoring-electromagnetic couplings, increased the operating bandwidth considerably. The system was parametrically excited using an electrodynamic shaker, and the corresponding motions of the magnets were measured. By increasing the tuning parameter, the fundamental natural frequency reduces and the system nonlinearity significantly increases; it has been discovered that when the initial axial displacement is approximately the thickness of the beam the fundamental and principal parametric resonance branches combine thus, the frequency bandwidth (and hence the range of the energy harvested) is significantly increased due to the parametric excitation, nonlinear behavior, and initial axial displacement.},

	abstract = {We present a human-limb driven piezoelectric energy harvester using two mass-loaded unimorph piezoelectric beams clamped on two flexible sidewalls. Since vibration generated by human-limb motion has low-frequency and high amplitude characteristics, the energy harvester has been designed to up-convert the low-frequency human-limb vibration by mechanical impact of a spring less spherical metallic ball. However, instead of direct mechanical impact on the power generating elements (unimorph piezoelectric beams), the ball impacts on the bases (flexible sidewalls) of each beam to avoid mechanical wear of the piezo-materials. While excited by human-limb motion, the ball impacts consecutively on the flexible sidewalls which transfer impulsive forces to the loaded mass of the respective unimorph beam. The beam vibrates at its own resonant frequency and causes voltage generation by virtue of piezoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept prototype has been fabricated and tested. At optimum load condition, each unimorph piezoelectric generator generates 96 µW average power while excited at 4.96 Hz frequency and {\textasciitilde}2g acceleration. The device with series connected generators is capable of generating maximum 175 µW average power. Improved design and further optimization would be able to increase its power generation capability (as well as power density) to be used in wearable devices applications.},

	abstract = {This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable—human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.},

High-throughput phenotyping approaches have been used in isolated growth chambers or greenhouses, but there is a growing need for field-based, precision agriculture techniques to measure large quantities of plants at high spatial and temporal resolutions throughout a growing season. A low-cost, tracked mobile robot was developed to collect phenotypic data for individual plants and tested on two separate energy sorghum fields in Central Illinois during summer 2016. Stereo imaging techniques determined plant height, and a depth sensor measured stem width near the base of the plant. A data capture rate of 0.4 ha, bi-weekly, was demonstrated for platform robustness consistent with various environmental conditions and crop yield modeling needs, and formative human–robot interaction observations were made during the field trials to address usability. This work is of interest to researchers and practitioners advancing the field of plant breeding because it demonstrates a new phenotyping platform that can measure individual plant architecture traits accurately (absolute measurement error at 15\% for plant height and 13\% for stem width) over large areas at a sub-daily frequency; furthermore, the design of this platform can be extended for phenotyping applications in maize or other agricultural row crops.},

	abstract = {While machines called weeding robots are now commercially available and many more designs are being actively researched, I contend that current machines are not truly robotic weeders, rather they are essentially self-guiding vehicles carrying weeding tools. I consider true robotic weeders to be a far more difficult objective. While advances in robotics have been outstanding, the weeding component often appears to be an afterthought. I contend that the weeding is as complex as the robotics. A genuine weeding robot should be able to: (i) monitor the crop, weeds, weather and soil, (ii) decide when the crop should be weeded, (iii) choose the optimal weeder, (iv) take the weeder to the field, (v) adjust the weeder for optimal performance, (vi) continuously monitor the entire weeder for blockages and mechanical breakages and fix them in the field, (vii) continuously monitor and adjust the weeder's performance, (viii) return the weeder to the farmyard and (ix) clean, maintain and store the weeder, that is replace all human intervention. This ten-point list both defines and is a guide to what is required for completely autonomous robotic weeding. Currently, this list is far beyond current technology and it may be decades before it is realisable. The aim of this study therefore was not to disparage the achievements of agricultural roboticists, rather it is to highlight the complexity and demands of mechanical weeding and therefore describe what is really required to create a true robotic weeder. I therefore hope it will guide and expedite research and lead to more rapid success for robotic weeding.},

The system consists of two independent subsystems, a fast image processing delivering results in real-time (Fast Image Processing, FIP), and a slower and more accurate processing (Robust Crop Row Detection, RCRD) that is used to correct the first subsystem’s mistakes. This combination produces a system that achieves very good results under a wide variety of conditions. Tested on several maize videos taken of different fields and during different years, the system successfully detects an average of 95\% of weeds and 80\% of crops under different illumination, soil humidity and weed/crop growth conditions. Moreover, the system has been shown to produce acceptable results even under very difficult conditions, such as in the presence of dramatic sowing errors or abrupt camera movements. The computer vision system has been developed for integration into a treatment system because the ideal setup for any weed sprayer system would include a tool that could provide information on the weeds and crops present at each point in real-time, while the tractor mounting the spraying bar is moving.},

As most crops are cultivated in rows, an important step towards this long-term goal is the development of a row-recognition system, which will allow a robot to accurately follow a row of plants. In this paper we describe a new method for robust recognition of plant rows based on the Hough transform. Our method adapts to the size of plants, is able to fuse information coming from two rows or more and is very robust against the presence of many weeds. The accuracy of the position estimation relative to the row proved to be good with a standard deviation between 0.6 and 1.2cm depending on the plant size. The system has been tested on both an inter-row cultivator and a mobile robot. Extensive field tests have showed that the system is sufficiently accurate and fast to control the cultivator and the mobile robot in a closed-loop fashion with a standard deviation of the position of 2.7 and 2.3cm, respectively. The vision system is also able to detect exceptional situations by itself, for example the occurrence of the end of a row.},

This paper presents a system for site-specific weed control in sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.), maize (Zea mays L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), including online weed detection using digital image analysis, computer-based decision making and global positioning systems (GPS)-controlled patch spraying. In a 4-year study, herbicide use with this map-based approach was reduced in winter cereals by 60\% for herbicides against broad-leaved weeds and 90\% for grass weed herbicides. In sugarbeet and maize, average savings for grass weed herbicides were 78\% in maize and 36\% in sugarbeet. For herbicides against broad-leaved weeds, 11\% were saved in maize and 41\% in sugarbeet.},

To be cost-effective, the robotics solution must be competitive with current human-driven farm machinery. Significant costs are in high-end localization and obstacle detection sensors. Our system demonstrates a combination of an inexpensive global positioning system and inertial navigation system with vision for localization and a single stereo vision system for obstacle detection. The paper describes the design of the robot, including detailed descriptions of three key parts of the system: novelty-based obstacle detection, visually-aided guidance, and a navigation system that generates collision-free kinematically feasible paths. The robot has seen extensive testing over numerous weeks of field trials during the day and night. The results in this paper pertain to one particular 3 h nighttime experiment in which the robot performed a coverage task and avoided obstacles. Additional results during the day demonstrate that the robot is able to continue operating during 5 min GPS outages by visually following crop rows.},

	abstract = {Environmental and commercial pressures are pushing vegetable and salad growers away from a reliance on herbicides. Whilst inter-row cultivation provides a relatively efficient method of removing weeds between crop rows, hand labour is often required to remove weeds within rows. A machine vision guidance has been used to address the problem of mechanically removing weeds within rows of transplanted vegetables and salads. The experimental machine was based on a commercially available steerage hoe equipped with conventional inter-row cultivation blades. It was also fitted with two novel shallow cultivation modules acting within crop rows. Each module featured a hydraulically driven disc rotating about a substantially vertical axis. Each disc had an interior section cut away to allow crop plants to pass undamaged. A vision system detected the phase of approaching plants and that information was combined with measured disc rotation to calculate a phase error between the next plant and disc cut-out. This phase error was corrected by advancing or retarding the hydraulic drive enabling synchronisation of the mechanism even in the presence of crop spacing variability. Field trials in transplanted cabbage indicated that under normal commercial growing conditions crop damage levels were low with weed reductions in the range 62–87\% measured within a 240mm radius zone around crop plants.},

The robotic arm presents a parallel structure with six degrees of freedom, and due to its light structure, it is capable of reaching high accelerations. The end-effector has an electrode powered by a set of batteries and kills the weeds by producing an electrical discharge of 15 000 V. All the subsystems of the machine communicate through a controller area network (CAN) bus. There are two vision systems mounted on the machine. The first one is placed at the front of the robot to acquire and analyse field images, in order to detect weeds and send their coordinates to the robotic arm control. The second camera is placed close to the electrode, and its mission is to correct inertial perturbations by relocating every individual weed detected by the first vision system The successful performance of this new concept of precise non-chemical weeding has been demonstrated in a lettuce crop in Valencia, Spain.},

Intelligent weeders are now being developed which oﬀer more advanced ways to control weeds, including larger ones and to leave the crop plants unharmed. One of the ﬁrst commercially available intelligent weeders, the Sarl Radis from France, has a simple crop detection system based on light interception, which guides a hoe in and out of the crop row, around the crop plants. The inclusion of innovative technologies, including advanced sensing and robotics, in combination with new cropping systems, might lead to a breakthrough in physical weed control in row crops leading to signiﬁcant reductions, or even elimination, of the need for hand weeding.},

	abstract = {One way of guiding autonomous vehicles through the field is using a vision based row detection system. A new approach for row recognition is presented which is based on grey-scale Hough transform on intelligently merged images resulting in a considerable improvement of the speed of image processing. A colour camera was used to obtain images from an experimental sugar beet field in a greenhouse. The colour images are transformed into grey scale images resulting in good contrast between plant material and soil background. Three different transformation methods were compared. The grey scale images are divided in three sections that are merged into one image, creating less data while still having information of three rows. It is shown that the algorithm is able to find the row at various growth stages. It does not make a difference which of the three colour to grey scale transformation methods is used. The mean error between the estimated and real crop row per measurement series varied from 5 to 198 mm. The median error from the crop row detection was 22 mm. The higher errors are mainly due to factors that do not occur in practice or that can be avoided, such as a limited number and a limited size of crop plants, overexposure of the camera, and the presence of green algae due to the use of a greenhouse. Inaccuracies created by footprints indicate that linear structures in the soil surface in a real field might create problems which should be considered in additional investigations. In two measurement series that did not suffer from these error sources, the algorithm was able to find the row with mean errors of 5 and 11 mm with standard deviations of 6 and 11 mm. The image processing time varied from 0.5 to 1.3 s per image.},

	abstract = {Soil compaction is one of the major problems facing modern agriculture. Overuse of machinery, intensive cropping, short crop rotations, intensive grazing and inappropriate soil management leads to compaction. Soil compaction occurs in a wide range of soils and climates. It is exacerbated by low soil organic matter content and use of tillage or grazing at high soil moisture content. Soil compaction increases soil strength and decreases soil physical fertility through decreasing storage and supply of water and nutrients, which leads to additional fertiliser requirement and increasing production cost. A detrimental sequence then occurs of reduced plant growth leading to lower inputs of fresh organic matter to the soil, reduced nutrient recycling and mineralisation, reduced activities of micro-organisms, and increased wear and tear on cultivation machinery. This paper reviews the work related to soil compaction, concentrating on research that has been published in the last 15 years. We discuss the nature and causes of soil compaction and the possible solutions suggested in the literature. Several approaches have been suggested to address the soil compaction problem, which should be applied according to the soil, environment and farming system. The following practical techniques have emerged on how to avoid, delay or prevent soil compaction: (a) reducing pressure on soil either by decreasing axle load and/or increasing the contact area of wheels with the soil; (b) working soil and allowing grazing at optimal soil moisture; (c) reducing the number of passes by farm machinery and the intensity and frequency of grazing; (d) confining traffic to certain areas of the field (controlled traffic); (e) increasing soil organic matter through retention of crop and pasture residues; (f) removing soil compaction by deep ripping in the presence of an aggregating agent; (g) crop rotations that include plants with deep, strong taproots; (h) maintenance of an appropriate base saturation ratio and complete nutrition to meet crop requirements to help the soil/crop system to resist harmful external stresses.},

Reference SD charts were constructed by the LMS method. Correlations were analysed in three age groups. SH/H data from patients with Marfan syndrome and genetically confirmed hypochondroplasia were compared with height corrected SH/H references.
Results: A positive association was observed between H SDS, SH SDS, and LL SDS in all age groups. There was a negative correlation between SH/H SDS and height SDS. In short children with a height SDS ,22 SDS, a cut-off limit of +2.5 SD leads to a more acceptable percentage of false positive results. In exceptionally tall children, a cut-off limit of 22.2 SDS can be used. Alternatively, a nomogram of SH/H SDS versus H SDS can be helpful. The sensitivity of the height corrected cut-off lines for hypochondroplasia was 80\% and for Marfan syndrome only 30\%.
Conclusions: In exceptionally short or tall children, the dependency of the SH/H ratio (SDS) on height SDS has to be taken into consideration in the evaluation of body proportions. The sensitivity of the cut-off lines for hypochondroplasia is fair.},

Methods: subjects were 230 healthy volunteers. Gait was timed over a 7.62 m expanse of floor. Actual and height normalized speed were determined. Lower extremity muscle strength was measured with a hand-held dynamometer.
Results: mean comfortable gait speed ranged from 127.2 cm/s for women in their seventies to 146.2 cm/s for men in their forties. Mean maximum gait speed ranged from 174.9 cm/s for women in their seventies to 253-3 cm/s for men in their twenties. Both gait speed measures were reliable (coefficients {\textgreater} 0.903) and correlated significantly with age ( r {\textasciicircum} — 0.210), height ( r {\textasciicircum} 0.220) and the strengths of four measured lower extremity muscle actions (r = 0.190-0.500). The muscle action strengths most strongly correlated with gait speed were nondominant hip abduction (comfortable speed) and knee extension (maximum speed).
Conclusions: these normative values should give clinicians a reference against which patient performance can be compared in a variety of settings. Gait speed can be expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and of lesser height and lower extremity muscle strength.},

	abstract = {A suspended-load backpack is a device that is designed to capture the mechanical energy created as a suspended backpack load oscillates vertically on the back during gait. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of a suspended-load backpack system on selected temporal and kinetics parameters describing gait. Nine male participants carried a suspended-load backpack as they walked on an instrumented treadmill with varied levels of load (no backpack, 22.5 kg, and 29.3 kg) and walking speed (1.16 m/s, 1.43 m/s, 1.70 m/s). As the participants performed this treadmill task, ground reaction forces were collected from an instrumented treadmill system. From these data, temporal variables (cycle time, single support time, and double support time) and kinetic variables (normalized weight acceptance force, normalized push-off force, and normalized mid-stance force) were derived. The results showed that the response of the temporal variables were consistent with previous studies of conventional (i.e. stable load) backpacks. The response of the normalized push-off force, however, showed that increasing walking speed signiﬁcantly (p {\textless} 0.05) decreased the magnitude of this force, a result contrary to the literature concerning conventional backpacks where this force has been shown to signiﬁcantly increase. Further evaluation revealed that this reduction in force was the result of a phase shift between the movement of the carried load and the movement of the torso. This suggests that the motion of the load in a suspended-load backpack inﬂuences the gait biomechanics and should be considered as this technology advances.},

We extend a previous 2DOF model proposed by Ackerman and Seipel (2014) by adding a timed clutch to the suspension mechanism. The clutch allows the mechanism to switch between states of elastic or rigid connection of the backpack and the body. Periodic switching between the two states of the mechanism is either event-based or timing-based, and may result in inelastic impacts. We study the hybrid dynamics induced by the action of the clutch mechanism, analyze energy expenditure and stability of periodic solutions, and seek for optimal values of stiffness and switching times that minimize the energetic cost. It is found that in many cases, the clutch mechanism can significantly reduce energy expenditure compared to both rigid and elastic suspensions.},

	abstract = {An elastically-suspended backpack offers biomechanical beneﬁts by reducing peak interaction force, joint loads and chances of potential injuries as shown in previous studies. But whether it will reduce metabolic cost of the carrier (compared with the stifﬂy-attached pack) depends on the relation between the natural frequency of the suspension and walking frequency. Yet, no quantitative method can precisely evaluate to what extent the elasticity of suspension affects human walking energetics. We employ a single degree of freedom (DOF) model to quantitatively evaluate the effect of stiffness and damping of pack on human energetics. A surrogate of metabolic cost is proposed and utilized to estimate the energetics difference between carrying backpacks of different stiffness. The predicted difference is consistent with former backpack studies. The analysis reveals that the energy cost increases around the resonant frequency and the difference gets more signiﬁcant at higher walking speeds or with heavier loads. This method gives closer energetic estimation compared with previous studies. Yet there is potentially an underestimation of the energy difference indicating later models should contain horizontal motion to obtain more precise prediction.},

We theoretically model the dynamic stability of a human carrying a load using a coupled spring-mass-damper model and an actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, as these models have demonstrated the ability to correctly predict other aspects of locomotion with a load in prior work, such as body forces and energetic cost. We report that minimizing the load suspension natural frequency and damping ratio significantly reduces the stability of the load mass but may slightly improve the body stability of locomotion when compared to a rigidly attached load. These results imply that a highly-compliant load suspension could help stabilize body motion during human, animal, or robot load carriage, but at the cost of a more awkward (less stable) load.},

Additionally, a low-cost biorefinery approach is presented in the context of producing additional products using other streams (carbon dioxide and digestates) rather than methane generated during anaerobic digestion (AD). The scope and limitations of commercialization using microalgae for the production of biogas is also covered. Although full-scale experience is limited, implementation is increasing as indicated by the number of research projects supported worldwide.},

An intermediate settling device was integrated in order to adapt the feed-flow concentration and the flow rate. Digestion of C. vulgaris was studied under 16 and 28days hydraulic retention times (HRT), with a corresponding organic loading rate of 1gCODL−1. Increasing the HRT achieved 51\% COD removal with a methane production measured at 240mLgVSS-1. Performing different HRTs and dynamic monitoring during degradation highlighted differential hydrolysis of microalgae compartments. However, 50\% of the biomass did not undergo anaerobic digestion, even under long retention times. This points out the interest for further studies on pre-treatment performances and more generally speaking on the need for intensifying microalgae biomass digestion.},

By comparison, scavenging the organic energy residual/wastes from food production offers a far more profitable and sustainable proposition and has an energy potential that dwarfs anything biogas production from dedicated energy crops can realistically offer.

	abstract = {Microalgae grown in swine wastewater were used as a promising strategy to produce renewable energy by coupling wastewater bioremediation and biomass revalorization. The efficiency of a microalgae consortium treating swine slurry at different temperature (15 and 23 °C) and illumination periods (11 and 14 h) was assessed for biomass growth and nutrient removal at two NH4+ initial concentrations (80 and 250 mg L−1 NH4+). Favourable culture conditions (23 °C and 14 h of illumination) and high ammonium loads resulted in higher biomass production and greater nutrients removal rates. The initial N–NH4+ load determined the removal mechanism, thus ammonia stripping and nitrogen uptake accounted similarly in the case of high NH4+ load, while nitrogen uptake prevailed at low NH4+ load. Under favourable conditions, nitrogen availability in the media determined the composition of the biomass. In this context, carbohydrate-rich biomass was obtained in batch mode while semi-continuous operation resulted in protein-rich biomass. The revalorization of the resultant biomass was evaluated for biogas production. Methane yields in the range of 106–146 and 171 ml CH4 g COD−1 were obtained for the biomasses grown in batch and semi-continuous mode, respectively. Biomass grown under favourable conditions resulted in higher methane yields and closer to the theoretically achievable.},

Photobioreactors (closed systems for algae cultivation) suffer from high-energy expenditures for mixing and cooling, while cultures in large-scale open ponds, which have a more favorable net energy ratio, are unstable ecosystems in which maintaining selected strains for long periods is difficult. Techniques for supplying nutrients and CO2, for mixing and for harvesting and processing the biomass in an energy-efficient manner are still under study and development. Despite these impediments and although microalgae are not superior to higher plants in terms of photosynthetic efficiency and productivity, microalgal cultures remain one of the most attractive sources of feed, food and next-generation biofuels since microalgae can be grown in saline or seawater on nonarable lands, can use fertilizers with an almost 100\% efficiency, are able to attain much higher oil and protein yields than traditional crops and, being endowed with high growth rates, are easier to be improved via genetic and metabolic engineering.},

Nearly 60–70\% COD removal and 40–90\% NH3-N removal was achieved in the mixotrophic and heterotrophic culture, depending on the dilution ratio of the wastewater, while the highest removal percentage was obtained with 20-fold diluted wastewater. Mixotrophic cultivation by using fivefold diluted wastewater resulted in the highest biomass concentration of 3.96g/L. The carbohydrate content of the microalga grown on the wastewater can reach up to 58\% (per dry weight). The results indicated that the microalgae-based wastewater treatment can efficiently reduce the nutrients and COD level, and the resulting microalgal biomass had high carbohydrate content, thereby having potential applications for the fermentative production of biofuels or chemicals.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested by several authors that heavy metals might be removed from aqueous systems by phytoplanktonic algae, whose high capacity for accumulating dissolved metals has previously been described. This paper shows—by comparing results obtained on accumulation factors and growth rates in different models—that metal removal by means of algae is not feasible in practice. It was found that under optimum conditions in a static system the reduction of a given initial metal concentration by 50\% requires approx. 14 days, while in a dynamic model a retention time of approx. 19 days is needed to achieve the same reduction. Finally, measurements of nitrogenase activity inhibition caused by various concentrations of mercury and cadmium demonstrate that nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae can be used for biological sewage treatment only at very low heavy metal concentrations in the medium.},

	abstract = {Synthetic industrial effluent was prepared by stabilising low concentrations of oil (Catenex 11, Shell, UK) in aqueous dispersion with a non-ionic surfactant (Span 20) and dissolved air flotation (DAF) was used to clarify this wastewater. Operating parameters including saturator pressure, recycle ratio, and air to oil ratio, were investigated to find conditions that would enhance the efficiency of the DAF separation. The zeta potential of the emulsion droplets and flocculated oil droplets was determined and aluminium sulphate and four different cationic polyelectrolytes were used to destabilise the system. Measurements indicated that a saturator efficiency of about 90\% was achieved and it was found that increasing the working pressure of saturator had less effect in the separation of oil droplets than increasing recycle ratio. Optimum conditions for separation are obtained with an air to oil ratio of 0.0075 corresponding to a recycle ratio of 10\%. The zeta potential measurements indicate that oil droplets are negatively charged between pH 5 and 10. In addition the zeta potential measurements of flocculated oil droplets were found to depend strongly on the concentration of the polyelectrolyte. Although an inversion of the oil droplets charge was observed even at very low polyelectrolytes concentration. The polyelectrolytes were ineffective in enhancing the separation. This effect can be related to the structure of the polyelectrolytes and to the adsorption mechanism. In contrast, when aluminium sulphate was used it was found that it is important to decrease the magnitude of zeta potential in order to decrease electrostatic repulsion so that the emulsion was destabilised prior to flotation. Under these conditions DAF yields near complete oil separation even at moderate working pressure and recycle ratio when the oil droplets are destabilised.},

The aim of this research was to assess the feasibility of EC-process for industrial contaminated effluents from copper production, taking into consideration technical and economical factors. EC-technology claims to offer efficient removal rates for most types of wastewater impurities at low power consumption and without adding any precipitating agents.Materials and MethodsReal wastewater from Saraka stream with high concentrations of heavy metals was provided by RTB-BOR, a Serbian copper mining and smelting complex. Runs were performed on a 10 1 EC-reactor using aluminum plates as sacrificial electrodes and powered by a 40 A supply unit. Results concerning key factors like pH, conductivity and power consumption were measured in real time. Analysis of dissolved metal concentrations before and after treatment were carried out via ICP-OES and confirmed by an independent test via AAS.ResultsSeveral aspects were taken into account, including current density, conductivity, interfacial resistivity and reactor settings throughout the runs, in order to analyze all possible factors playing a role in neutralization and metal removal in real industrial wastewater.DiscussionElectrode configurations and their effects on energy demand were discussed and exemplified based on fundamentals of colloidal and physical chemistry.ConclusionsBased on experimental data and since no precipitating agents were applied, the EC-process proved to be not only feasible and environmentally-friendly, but also a cost-effective technology.Recommendations and PerspectivesThe EC-technology provides strategic guidelines for further research and development of sustainable water management processes. However, additional test series concerning continuous operation must be still performed in order to get this concept ready for future large-scale applications.},

	abstract = {The anaerobic digestion of microalgae is a prospective environmentally feasible option for creating a renewable source of energy for industrial and domestic needs. Microalgae anaerobic digestion is a key unit process that integrates efficiency and beneficially into the production of microalgae derived biofuels. Anaerobic digestion culminating in methane fermentation improves the economic viability of microalgae liquid biofuel production and presents an opportunity for power generation from wastewater derived microalgae. However the anaerobic digestion of microalgae biomass is not straight forward due to several technical restraints including low concentration of digestible biodegradable substrate, recalcitrant substrate constituents, cell wall degradability, low carbon to nitrogen ratio, ammonia toxicity and effects from salinity and associated metal ions. Current production methods for liquid biofuel production from microalgae produce approximately 60–70\% residual biomass that is currently a byproduct. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas, but it can also provide essential nutrient recovery from lipid extracted microalgae biomass. The biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion process can be used to generate onsite electrical power or thermal heat to offset biomass processing and extraction processes. When both of these processes are integrated and operated simultaneously, the benefits to microalgae biofuel production and wastewater treatment derived energy production are increased significantly. To consider the integration of anaerobic digestion into a commercial-scale integrated microalgae production and biofuel refinery facility or wastewater treatment plant we present a review of the literature, the current state of the art and future directions for research.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digesters convert organic waste (agricultural and food waste, animal or human manure, and other organic waste), into energy (in the form of biogas or electricity). An added benefit to bio-digestion is a leftover high-grade organic fertilizer. Models of the anaerobic digestion process do exist, but either rely on simple algebraic equations instead of biochemical reactions, or consider so many external parameters that they become overly complicated and require much input information and computation time. This work provides an intermediate kinetic model that predicts biogas output over time with few inputs. This kinetic model is justified by a small-scale laboratory experiment, and parameters are adjusted to match experimental results. This model can be used to optimize design parameters for an anaerobic digester, and provides information such as the relationship between digester sizing and feed rate. The process used here may be expanded to other feedstock materials and repeated for other similar applications, in an effort to expand anaerobic digestion systems as a clean energy source.},

An intermediate settling device was integrated in order to adapt the feed-flow concentration and the flow rate. Digestion of C. vulgaris was studied under 16 and 28days hydraulic retention times (HRT), with a corresponding organic loading rate of 1gCODL−1. Increasing the HRT achieved 51\% COD removal with a methane production measured at 240mLgVSS-1. Performing different HRTs and dynamic monitoring during degradation highlighted differential hydrolysis of microalgae compartments. However, 50\% of the biomass did not undergo anaerobic digestion, even under long retention times. This points out the interest for further studies on pre-treatment performances and more generally speaking on the need for intensifying microalgae biomass digestion.},

The total COD recovered as biogas was in the order of 52\%. The input suspension was converted to a clear effluent rich in total ammonium nitrogen (546 mg TAN L−1) and phosphate (141 mg PO4-P L−1) usable as liquid fertilizer. The microbial community richness, dynamics, and organization in the reactor were interpreted using the microbial resource management approach. The AnMBR communities were found to be moderate in species richness and low in dynamics and community organization relative to UASB and conventional CSTR sludges. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Methanosaeta sp. was the dominant acetoclastic methanogen species followed by Methanosarcina sp. This work demonstrated that the use of AnMBR for the digestion of algal biomass is possible. The fact that some 50\% of the organic matter is not liquefied means that the algal particulates in the digestate constitute a considerable fraction which should be valorized properly, for instance as slow release organic fertilizer. Overall, 1 kg of algae dry matter (DM) could be valorized in the form of biogas (€2.07), N and P in the effluent (€0.02) and N and P in the digestate (€0.04), thus totaling about €2.13 per kilogram algae DM.},

	abstract = {Dissolved Air (Pressure) Flotation-DAF, is a well-established solid and/or liquid/liquid separation process that uses micro-bubbles as a carrier phase. Bubbles are formed by a reduction of pressure of a water stream previously saturated with air (gas) at pressures usually higher than 3 atm. In industrial practice, the supersaturated water is forced trough needle valves, and clouds of bubbles having 0.02-0.15 mm in diameter are produced just down-stream of the constriction. Typically 5–20\% of the water leaving the flotation tank is recycled. This process is widely used in the treatment of industrial wastewaters for the removal or separation of metal ions, anions, oil, greases, chemicals, microorganisms, colloids and ultrafines. A disadvantage of the process is the high cost of water saturation required for bubble formation. The present work shows that bubble generation is possible at working pressures lower than 2–3 atm by lowering the surface tension in the saturator and at the flow constriction. It is concluded that very low concentrations of surfactants or “collectors” are required to make DAF now feasible at 2 atm or less, thereby reducing drastically the cost of energy and optimizing the whole process.},

Electrodeposition is effective in recover heavy metals from wastewater streams. It is considered as an established technology with possible further development in the improvement of space-time yield. EC has been in use for water production or wastewater treatment. It is finding more applications using either aluminum, iron or the hybrid Al/Fe electrodes. The separation of the flocculated sludge from the treated water can be accomplished by using EF. The EF technology is effective in removing colloidal particles, oil \& grease, as well as organic pollutants. It is proven to perform better than either dissolved air flotation, sedimentation, impeller flotation (IF). The newly developed stable and active electrodes for oxygen evolution would definitely boost the adoption of this technology. Electrooxidation is finding its application in wastewater treatment in combination with other technologies. It is effective in degrading the refractory pollutants on the surface of a few electrodes. Titanium-based boron-doped diamond film electrodes (Ti/BDD) show high activity and give reasonable stability. Its industrial application calls for the production of Ti/BDD anode in large size at reasonable cost and durability.},

	abstract = {Cell disruption is one of the most critical steps affecting the economy and yields of biotechnological processes for producing biofuels from microalgae. Enzymatic cell disruption has shown competitive results compared to mechanical or chemical methods. However, the addition of enzymes implies an associated cost in the overall production process. Recent studies have employed algicidal microorganisms to perform enzymatic cell disruption and degradation of microalgae biomass in order to reduce this associated cost. Algicidal microorganisms induce microalgae growth inhibition, death and subsequent lysis. Secreted algicidal molecules and enzymes produced by bacteria, cyanobacteria, viruses and the microalga themselves that are capable of inducing algal death are classified, and the known modes of action are described along with insights into cell-to-cell interaction and communication. This review aims to provide information regarding microalgae degradation by microorganisms and secreted algicidal substances that would be useful for microalgae cell breakdown in biofuels production processes. A better understanding of algae-to-algae communication and the specific mechanisms of algal cell lysis is expected to be an important breakthrough for the broader application of algicidal microorganisms in biological cell disruption and the production of biofuels from microalgae biomass.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae is primarily inhibited by the chemical composition of their cell walls containing biopolymers able to resist bacterial degradation. Adoption of pre-treatments such as thermal, thermal hydrolysis, ultrasound and enzymatic hydrolysis have the potential to remove these inhibitory compounds and enhance biogas yields by degrading the cell wall, and releasing the intracellular algogenic organic matter (AOM). This work investigated the effect of four pre-treatments on three microalgae species, and their impact on the quantity of soluble biomass released in the media and thus on the digestion process yields. The analysis of the composition of the soluble COD released and of the TEM images of the cells showed two main degradation actions associated with the processes: (1) cell wall damage with the release of intracellular AOM (thermal, thermal hydrolysis and ultrasound) and (2) degradation of the cell wall constituents with the release of intracellular AOM and the solubilisation of the cell wall biopolymers (enzymatic hydrolysis). As a result of this, enzymatic hydrolysis showed the greatest biogas yield increments ({\textgreater}270\%) followed by thermal hydrolysis (60–100\%) and ultrasounds (30–60\%).},

It is shown that in both cases, upon reactive control more power can be harvested; however, it may come at the cost of a higher velocity, peak power, and force requirement. Moreover, an equivalent circuit is proposed for the trans-rotary magnetic gear (TROMAG) which helps understand the system dynamics under the two control strategies.},

	doi = {10.1109/AIM.2018.8452373},
	abstract = {The exploration of biomechanical energy harvesting has taken places for more than a decade, with the purpose to enable more wearable electronics to power themselves by scavenging the energy associated with the local body motions. In the studies of energy harvesting backpack, most of the previous designs were built by responding to the inertia-driven excitation in the vertical direction during walking. Based on scrutiny of the human walking posture when wearing a backpack, we find that the vertical movement of the backpack only dominates in brisk walking or jogging. The horizontal swing plays a more significant role when the walking speed is lower than 4 km/h, which is the normal walking speed of healthy people. According to this finding, this paper proposes a light weight and non-resonant type backpack harvester for harvesting energy under different walking speeds. A prototyped harvesting backpack is manufactured, tested, and validated with the theoretical model. The experiment shows that, when the test subject walks at 4 km/h wearing a backpack of 1.5 kg, the prototyped harvester, whose weights is 0.5 kg, can harvest about 0.3-watt power. Testing results also show that the energy harvesting function in the proposed design does not impede the walking posture.},

Tidal barrages have the potential to cause significant ecological impacts particularly on bird feeding areas when they are constructed at coastal estuaries or bays. Offshore tidal stream energy and wave energy collectors offer the scope for developments at varying scales. They also have the potential to alter habitats.

Tidal lagoons work on the same principle as tidal barrages and have been proposed as a possible alternative. The main attraction to tidal lagoons is that they offer generation capacities similar to barrages but do not have the same environmental effects. Another method of capturing the energy from the tidal range is through a concept known as tidal delay which is an innovative idea being developed by Woodshed Technologies. In contrast to barrages and tidal lagoons, tidal stream turbines (TSTs) use the kinetic energy of the tide directly, and unlike the impoundment schemes, TSTs allow the water to pass through and around them and do not require the storage of water. The main categories into which most devices fall are horizontal-axis tidal turbines (HATTs), vertical axis tidal turbines (VATTs), venturi effect devices and oscillating hydrofoils, though other novel designs such as ‘kites’ can be found.},

	abstract = {In 2016,  low-carbon energy sources (i.e. renewables and nuclear energy) continued to dominate the electricity mix for the second year in a row,   together   generating more power than fossil fuel sources.  
 
 Fossil fuels (i.e. coal, natural gas and oil) were responsible for 43 \% of all gross electricity generation in 2016, a decrease of 11 percentage points across the EU compared with 2005 (54 \%). 
 By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources has grown rapidly since 2005, but the pace of growth has slowed down after 2014. In 2016, renewable electricity reached almost one third (29 \%) of all gross electricity generation in the EU. This is twice as much as in 2005. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2016 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite. 
 Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter (26 \%) of all gross electricity generation in 2016. 
 
  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels, together with improved transformation efficiencies in electricity generation, led to an average annual 2.6 \% decrease in CO  2   emissions per kWh between 2005 and 2016.  
  Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) in the EU increased by one percent in 2016 compared with 2015, reaching the same level as in 2005. The sharpest growth was observed in the services sector (1.2 \% per year) and the sharpest decline in industry (-1.0 \% per year).  
    With regards to the non-EU EEA countries,   between 2005 and 2016, electricity generation increased by an average of 4.9 \% per   year in Turkey, 7.1 \% per year   in Iceland and 0.7 \% per year in Norway.},

The objective of this study is to (i) analyze the dynamic load of the suspended-load backpack over a range of walking speeds and pack masses, and (ii) determine the optimal design parameters for the suspended-load backpack to minimize the effect of dynamic load on the efficiency of walking. A simple spring, damper and mass system is used to model the performance of the suspended-load backpack as well as the typical hiking pack. The oscillating load and phase angle are calculated over a range of loading and spring stiffness values to determine the system resonance and optimal spring stiffness design range for the suspended-load backpack. Our results reveal that the stiffness for the suspended-load backpack should be designed below one half of the resonance stiffness to minimize dynamic loads at a given walking speed. The location and magnitude of the maximum phase angle is also calculated. A performance comparison between the suspended-load backpack and a typical hiking pack demonstrates the beneficial range for the suspended-load backpack. The suspended-load backpack is found to provide significant reductions in the peak backpack load, compared with a typical hiking pack, while carrying large loads at fast walking speeds. The suspended-load backpack performs poorly for low pack loads due to in-phase oscillations between the pack and the walking person.},

	abstract = {PurposeOceans offer a vast amount of renewable energy. Tidal and wave energy devices are currently the most advanced conduits of ocean energy. To date, only a few life cycle assessments for ocean energy have been carried out for ocean energy. This study analyses ocean energy devices, including all technologies currently being proposed, in order to gain a better understanding of their environmental impacts and explore how they can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply.MethodsThe study followed the methodology of life cycle assessment including all life cycle steps from cradle to grave. The various types of device were assessed, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 kWh of electricity delivered to the grid. The impact categories investigated were based on the ILCD recommendations. The life cycle models were set up using detailed technical information on the components and structure of around 180 ocean energy devices from an in-house database.Results and discussionThe design of ocean energy devices still varies considerably, and their weight ranges from 190 to 1270 t, depending on device type. Environmental impacts are closely linked to material inputs and are caused mainly by mooring and foundations and structural components, while impacts from assembly, installation and use are insignificant for all device types. Total greenhouse gas emissions of ocean energy devices range from about 15 to 105 g CO2-eq. kWh−1. Average global warming potential for all device types is 53 ± 29 g CO2-eq. kWh−1. The results of this study are comparable with those of other studies and confirm that the environmental impacts of ocean energy devices are comparable with those of other renewable technologies and can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply.ConclusionsOcean energy devices are still at an early stage of development compared with other renewable energy technologies. Their environmental impacts can be further reduced by technology improvements already being pursued by developers (e.g. increased efficiency and reliability). Future life cycle assessment studies should assess whole ocean energy arrays or ocean energy farms.},

	abstract = {In 2016,  low-carbon energy sources (i.e. renewables and nuclear energy) continued to dominate the electricity mix for the second year in a row,   together   generating more power than fossil fuel sources.  
 
 Fossil fuels (i.e. coal, natural gas and oil) were responsible for 43 \% of all gross electricity generation in 2016, a decrease of 11 percentage points across the EU compared with 2005 (54 \%). 
 By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources has grown rapidly since 2005, but the pace of growth has slowed down after 2014. In 2016, renewable electricity reached almost one third (29 \%) of all gross electricity generation in the EU. This is twice as much as in 2005. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2016 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite. 
 Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter (26 \%) of all gross electricity generation in 2016. 
 
  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels, together with improved transformation efficiencies in electricity generation, led to an average annual 2.6 \% decrease in CO  2   emissions per kWh between 2005 and 2016.  
  Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) in the EU increased by one percent in 2016 compared with 2015, reaching the same level as in 2005. The sharpest growth was observed in the services sector (1.2 \% per year) and the sharpest decline in industry (-1.0 \% per year).  
    With regards to the non-EU EEA countries,   between 2005 and 2016, electricity generation increased by an average of 4.9 \% per   year in Turkey, 7.1 \% per year   in Iceland and 0.7 \% per year in Norway.},

These estimates are compared to those for ten other electricity generation technologies whose costs were identified by the UK Government (DTI, 2006). Under plausible assumptions for costs and performance, point estimates of the levelised costs of Wave and Tidal Stream generation are £190 and £81/MWh, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows how these relative private levelised costs calculations are affected by variation in key parameters, specifically the assumed capital costs, fuel costs and the discount rate. We also consider the impact of the introduction of technology-differentiated financial support for renewable energy on the cost competitiveness of Wave and Tidal Stream power. Further, we compare the impact of the current UK government support level to the more generous degree of assistance for marine technologies that is proposed by the Scottish government.},

After having estimated the many costs and benefits and having calculated the net present value of such a project, it is concluded here that the project should not proceed as its costs greatly surpass its benefits. However, it is recommended that further studies evaluating the costs and benefits at different levels of tidal penetration be conducted for the province.},

	abstract = {The exploitation of technologies with which to harness the energy from ocean currents will have considerable possibilities in the future thanks to their enormous potential for electricity production and their high predictability. In this respect, the development of methodologies for the economic viability of these technologies is fundamental to the attainment of a consistent quantification of their costs and the discovery of their economic viability, while simultaneously attracting investment in these technologies. This paper presents a methodology with which to determine the economic viability of tidal energy projects, which includes a technical study of the life-cycle costs into which the development of a tidal farm can be decomposed: concept and definition, design and development, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance and dismantling. These cost structures are additionally subdivided by considering their sub-costs and bearing in mind the main components of the tidal farm: the nacelle, the supporting tidal energy converter structure and the export power system. Furthermore, a technical study is developed in order to obtain an estimation of the annual energy produced (and, consequently, the incomes generated if the electric tariff is known) by considering its principal attributes: the characteristics of the current, the ability of the device to capture energy and its ability to convert and export the energy. The methodology has been applied (together with a sensibility analysis) to the particular case of a farm composed of first generation tidal energy converters in one of the Channel Island Races, the Alderney Race, in the U.K., and the results have been attained by means of the computation of engineering indexes, such as the net present value, the internal rate of return, the discounted payback period and the levelized cost of energy, which indicate that the proposed project is economically viable for all the case studies.},

A large variety of new lower cost and less invasive methods have since emerged in the forms of tidal lagoons, reefs and fences. Since the construction of La Rance in 1967, advancements in turbine technologies and design has since resulted in a plethora of new, exciting turbine designs for tidal energy. A selection of new turbines with possible tidal range applications includes the modified bulb turbine with two sets of guide vanes, a counter-rotating turbine, Archimedes screw and a gyro device. However, the same design is continuously being chosen – the Kaplan bulb turbine. Through the use of a marking criterion covering key aspects that should be considered when choosing a turbine a variety of the new designs available are investigated. The key aspects researched include, environmental effects, the two-way efficiency, initial costs and maintenance costs/difficulty.},

In this work, we present a new geospatial tool to determine the optimum sites for tidal stream energy exploitation based on this fundamental requirement of economic feasibility, and more specifically, on the LCOE (levelised cost of energy): LCOE mapping. The methodology combines numerical model results of the resource with economic assessments in a Matlab-based tool designed ad hoc. Thus, not only the spatial variability of the resource but also its all-important temporal variability is considered. In particular, the energy density is obtained by means of numerical integration of the power density throughout a tidal cycle. The new tool allows for considering the diameter and power curve of the specific turbines, too. As a case study, the method is applied to the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary (UK), one of the most promising areas for tidal stream exploitation in the UK. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed and thus, cost trends are analysed. In summary, the LCOE map constitutes a new tool to assess tidal stream sites in an area of interest based on a fundamental economic parameter of an energy project: the LCOE.},

When viewed in a holistic manner, including initial materials extraction, manufacturing, use and disposal/decommissioning, these 41 studies show that both wind and solar systems are directly tied to and responsible for GHG emissions. They are thus not actually emissions free technologies. Moreover, by spotlighting the lifecycle stages and physical characteristics of these technologies that are most responsible for emissions, improvements can be made to lower their carbon footprint. As such, through in-depth examination of the results of these studies and the variations therein, this article uncovers best practices in wind and solar design and deployment that can better inform climate change mitigation efforts in the electricity sector.},

	abstract = {In reviewing life cycle assessment (LCA) literature of utility-scale concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, this analysis focuses on reducing variability and clarifying the central tendency of published estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a meta-analytical process called harmonization. From 125 references reviewed, 10 produced 36 independent GHG emissions estimates passing screens for quality and relevance: 19 for parabolic trough (trough) technology and 17 for power tower (tower) technology. The interquartile range (IQR) of published estimates for troughs and towers were 83 and 20 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh),1 respectively; median estimates were 26 and 38 g CO2-eq/kWh for trough and tower, respectively. Two levels of harmonization were applied. Light harmonization reduced variability in published estimates by using consistent values for key parameters pertaining to plant design and performance. The IQR and median were reduced by 87\% and 17\%, respectively, for troughs. For towers, the IQR and median decreased by 33\% and 38\%, respectively. Next, five trough LCAs reporting detailed life cycle inventories were identified. The variability and central tendency of their estimates are reduced by 91\% and 81\%, respectively, after light harmonization. By harmonizing these five estimates to consistent values for global warming intensities of materials and expanding system boundaries to consistently include electricity and auxiliary natural gas combustion, variability is reduced by an additional 32\% while central tendency increases by 8\%. These harmonized values provide useful starting points for policy makers in evaluating life cycle GHG emissions from CSP projects without the requirement to conduct a full LCA for each new project.},

	abstract = {Geothermal binary power plants that use low-temperature heat sources have gained increasing interest in the recent years due to political efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of finite energy resources. The construction of such plants requires large amounts of energy and material. Hence, the question arises if geothermal binary power plants are also environmentally promising from a cradle-to-grave point of view. In this context, a comprehensive Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) on geothermal power production from EGS (enhanced geothermal systems) low-temperature reservoirs is performed. The results of the analysis show that the environmental impacts are very much influenced by the geological conditions that can be obtained at a specific site. At sites with (above-) average geological conditions, geothermal binary power generation can significantly contribute to more sustainable power supply. At sites with less favorable conditions, only certain plant designs can make up for the energy and material input to lock up the geothermal reservoir by the provided energy. The main aspects of environmentally sound plants are enhancement of the reservoir productivity, reliable design of the deep wells and an efficient utilization of the geothermal fluid for net power and district heat production.},

This study examined the comparative sustainability of four renewable electricity technologies in terms of their life cycle CO2 emissions and embodied energy, from construction to decommissioning and including maintenance (periodic component replacement plus machinery use), using life cycle analysis. The models developed were based on case studies of power plants in New Zealand, comprising geothermal, large-scale hydroelectric, tidal (a proposed scheme), and wind-farm electricity generation. The comparative results showed that tidal power generation was associated with 1.8 g of CO2/kWh, wind with 3.0 g of CO2/kWh, hydroelectric with 4.6 g of CO2/kWh, and geothermal with 5.6 g of CO2/kWh (not including fugitive emissions), and that tidal power generation was associated with 42.3 kJ/kWh, wind with 70.2 kJ/kWh, hydroelectric with 55.0 kJ/kWh, and geothermal with 94.6 kJ/kWh. Other environmental indicators, as well as social and economic indicators, should be applied to gain a complete picture of the technologies studied.},

With potential for the manufacture of significant numbers of such devices there is a need to assess their environmental impact and, in particular, their life cycle energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) performance. This paper presents an analysis of the life cycle energy use and CO2 emissions associated with the first generation of Seagen turbines. The detailed assessment covers the embodied energy and CO2 in the materials and manufacturing of components, device installation, and operation along with those for decommissioning. With relatively conservative assumptions, and despite the early stage of development, the study shows that at 214 kJ/kWh and 15 g CO2/kWh, the respective energy and carbon intensities are comparable with large wind turbines and very low relative to the 400 to 1000 g CO2/kWh typical of fossil‐fuelled generation. The energy payback period is approximately 14 months and the CO2 payback is around 8 months. The embodied energy and carbon show limited sensitivity to assumptions with environmental performance remains excellent even under the most adverse scenarios considered. Materials use is identified as the primary contributors to embodied energy and carbon with shipping also significant. Improvements in the environmental impact of the Seagen can be achieved primarily by increased structural efficiency and the use of alternative installation methods to increase recovery of steel at decommissioning.},

Gradually, after the scheme was put into service, an increasingly diverse flora and fauna became established. The patterns of distribution of this flora and fauna, their groupings into ecological units and the nature of their interrelationships, indicate a variable degree of biological adjustment to the new environmental conditions. Migratory organisms are able to pass via sluice gates and turbines. However, the new ecological equilibrium, established in the space of 10 years, remains fragile and, being linked to the degree of stability of abiotic conditions, depends to a large extent on the operating conditions of the power station.},

	abstract = {In 2016,  low-carbon energy sources (i.e. renewables and nuclear energy) continued to dominate the electricity mix for the second year in a row,   together   generating more power than fossil fuel sources.  
 
 Fossil fuels (i.e. coal, natural gas and oil) were responsible for 43 \% of all gross electricity generation in 2016, a decrease of 11 percentage points across the EU compared with 2005 (54 \%). 
 By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources has grown rapidly since 2005, but the pace of growth has slowed down after 2014. In 2016, renewable electricity reached almost one third (29 \%) of all gross electricity generation in the EU. This is twice as much as in 2005. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2016 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite. 
 Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter (26 \%) of all gross electricity generation in 2016. 
 
  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels, together with improved transformation efficiencies in electricity generation, led to an average annual 2.6 \% decrease in CO  2   emissions per kWh between 2005 and 2016.  
  Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) in the EU increased by one percent in 2016 compared with 2015, reaching the same level as in 2005. The sharpest growth was observed in the services sector (1.2 \% per year) and the sharpest decline in industry (-1.0 \% per year).  
    With regards to the non-EU EEA countries,   between 2005 and 2016, electricity generation increased by an average of 4.9 \% per   year in Turkey, 7.1 \% per year   in Iceland and 0.7 \% per year in Norway.},

Little additional information is normally given about the environmental circumstances. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different environments on walking speed. The design is an observational study. Method: Two groups (health controls and persons with late effects of polio) were studied, 30 meter walking test in convenient and maximal speed has been performed in 3 different environments. Results: Both groups walked faster outdoors when compared with the indoor settings and the test order did not significantly influence this. Conclusion: The findings from this study indicate that the traditional walking speed tests performed indoors may not be an optimal predictor of the walking speed outdoors.

	abstract = {We present a human-limb driven piezoelectric energy harvester using two mass-loaded unimorph piezoelectric beams clamped on two flexible sidewalls. Since vibration generated by human-limb motion has low-frequency and high amplitude characteristics, the energy harvester has been designed to up-convert the low-frequency human-limb vibration by mechanical impact of a spring less spherical metallic ball. However, instead of direct mechanical impact on the power generating elements (unimorph piezoelectric beams), the ball impacts on the bases (flexible sidewalls) of each beam to avoid mechanical wear of the piezo-materials. While excited by human-limb motion, the ball impacts consecutively on the flexible sidewalls which transfer impulsive forces to the loaded mass of the respective unimorph beam. The beam vibrates at its own resonant frequency and causes voltage generation by virtue of piezoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept prototype has been fabricated and tested. At optimum load condition, each unimorph piezoelectric generator generates 96 µW average power while excited at 4.96 Hz frequency and {\textasciitilde}2g acceleration. The device with series connected generators is capable of generating maximum 175 µW average power. Improved design and further optimization would be able to increase its power generation capability (as well as power density) to be used in wearable devices applications.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades the use of portable and wearable electronics has grown steadily. These devices are becoming increasingly more powerful. However, the gains that have been made in the device performance have resulted in the need for significantly higher power to operate the electronics. This issue has been further complicated due to the stagnant growth of battery technology over the past decade. In order to increase the life of these electronics, researchers have begun investigating methods of generating energy from ambient sources such that the life of the electronics can be prolonged. Recent developments in the field have led to the design of a number of mechanisms that can be used to generate electrical energy, from a variety of sources including thermal, solar, strain, inertia, etc. Many of these energy sources are available for use with humans, but their use must be carefully considered such that parasitic effects that could disrupt the user’s gait or endurance are avoided. These issues have arisen from previous attempts to integrate power harvesting mechanisms into a shoe such that the energy released during a heal strike could be harvested. This study develops a novel energy harvesting backpack that can generate electrical energy from the differential forces between the wearer and the pack. The goal of this system is to make the energy harvesting device transparent to the wearer such that his or her endurance and dexterity is not compromised. This will be accomplished by replacing the traditional strap of the backpack with one made of the piezoelectric polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Piezoelectric materials have a structure such that an applied electrical potential results in a mechanical strain. Conversely, an applied stress results in the generation of an electrical charge, which makes the material useful for power harvesting applications. PVDF is highly flexible and has a high strength, allowing it to effectively act as the load bearing member. In order to preserve the performance of the backpack and user, the design of the pack will be held as close to existing systems as possible. This paper develops a theoretical model of the piezoelectric strap and uses experimental testing to identify its performance in this application.},

With this technique it is possible to make the device thin (∼500 μm), lightweight (∼0.13 g cm−2), and flexible. In addition, the developed TE generator achieved an unprecedentedly large output power density which is several tens of times higher than that of flexible TE generators reported to date. The developed TE generator shows an allowable bending radius of as low as 20 mm and no change in performance by repeated bending for 120 cycles.

	abstract = {With a rapid development of various wearable electronics, self-powered system and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) have attracted increasingly widespread attention. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to seeking effective approaches to increase the triboelectric charge density of friction surfaces and thus further boost the output performance of TENG. Here, we designed a multilayered fiber-based TENG to greatly enhance the charge density by creatively introducing a charge-transport layer and a charge-storage layer in the composite structure. The introduced conductive material and dielectric material could effectively increase the transfer rate and storage depth of triboelectric charges during the triboelectrification process. The short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage of the three-layer structured TENG were distinctively 3.07 times and 2.56 times larger respectively compared with the single-layer structured TENG. The power density of three-layer structured TENG with an effective area of 9 cm2 can reach as high as 0.13 W/m2 under a frequency of 3 Hz. The fabricated TENG can be integrated into a commercial kneepad to harvest versatile biomechanical energy from human motions. Besides, the composite TENG was demonstrated to sustainably drive some small wearable or portable electronics such as electronic watch, commercial thermometer and calculator. This presented work provides an innovative and effective approach to design novel mechanical energy-conversion devices with high performance for practical applications in the field of self-powered wearable system.},

The resonant vibration amplitude of the magnet is 259.1 μm when the input vibration amplitude is 14 μm and the magnet-spring system is at resonance. Electromagnetic simulation shows that the linewidth and the turns of the coil influence the induced voltage greatly.

After the first introductory chapter, Chapter 2 explains how to calculate the mechanical actions (loads) in the fire situation based on the information given in EN 1990 and EN 1991. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the models which represent the thermal actions created by the fire. Chapter 4 describes the procedures to be used to calculate the temperature of the steelwork from the temperature of the compartment and Chapter 5 shows how the information given in EN 1993-1-2 is used to determine the load bearing capacity of the steel structure. Chapter 6 presents the essential features that characterize the advanced calculation models, for thermal and mechanical response. The methods used to evaluate the fire resistance of bolted and welded connections are described in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 describes a computer program called `Elefir-EN? which is based on the simple calculation model given in the Eurocode and allows designers to quickly and accurately calculate the performance of steel components in the fire situation. Chapter 9 looks at the issues that a designer may be faced with when assessing the fire resistance of a complete building. This is done via a case study and addresses most of the concepts presented in the previous chapters. For this second edition the content has been revised and extended. The book contains some new sections, e.g. a comparison between the simple and the advanced calculation, as well as additional examples.},
